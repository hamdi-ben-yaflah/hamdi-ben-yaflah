<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Hamdi Ben Yaflah</h1>
<h3 align="center">I’ve spent 5+ years building full stack web solutions with JavaScript, TypeScript, and AWS. My focus goes beyond the code: I care about the why behind a feature, how it fits into the bigger product vision, and how it impacts the end user. I love collaborating across teams to ensure what we deliver is both technically solid and truly meaningful.</h3>
